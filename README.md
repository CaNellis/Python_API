# Python API Practice
 
This report uses Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to track how weather changes as we approach the equator by specifically utilizing Python's Matplotlib library, Python's citypy library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and Jupyter Notebook to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. 

The change in weather in relation to the equator is displayed in a series of scatter plots depicting the following relationships: Temperature (F) vs. Latitude, Humidity (%) vs. Latitude, Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude, Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
